Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Data Analyst and Data Engineer based in Toronto, ON with a passion for turning complex data into meaningful insights (and maybe making it a little more fun along the way). With a background in agile methodologies, big data technologies, and a variety of programming languages, I’m here to solve your toughest data challenges (and throw in a bit of humor while I’m at it).
